	description = To ensure the standards of quality expected of Bluedog Design Bureau products, our engineers have developed this component for the RMA upper stage. A fully functioning autonomous command module, it allows an RMA stage to control itself for tasks such as disposal and spying on foreign powers. It has integrated batteries and a reaction wheel, and, because it's crammed around the top of the fuel tank, it includes a small amount of fuel.
