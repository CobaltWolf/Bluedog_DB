	description = This 1.25m tank is over twice as long as the FLT-800. You aren't ready for this kind of power. Maybe we'll have to take it away from you. (Please note that the tank is not filled to capacity by default - otherwise it would be too heavy to lift off with a standard PGM-Sandstone booster.)
